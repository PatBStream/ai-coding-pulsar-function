Develop an Apache Pulsar Function to read/receive a JSON message from a topic, process the JSON message, 
write the JSON message and payload to a logfile, then send a new JSON message with "Message State":"Received" as the payload, 
along with the original payload.  The function should have robust error handling, log any invalid messages.  
If the JSON message is invalid, send the bad message to another Pulsar topic for bad data. 

You need to determine the proper programming language to use, follow Apache Pulsar Function development best practices
